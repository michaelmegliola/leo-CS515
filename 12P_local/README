What challenges did you encounter? And how did you address them?

I originally used a sorted array instead of a priority queue to create the MST. That worked,
but would create MSTs that were correct, but different from those generated by the given
mynetwork. In an attempt to pass the tests I was failing, I switched data structures. I now
observe the same MST where there was previously a difference, but I am still failing some
tests.

Once the test cases were released, I noticed I was only failing when data4 was being used.
data4 is the only file where the first node is not alphabetically the first node. I had 
assumed that the starting node must be alphabetically first because it was not specified 
in the documentation. I changed my program to start at the first node given as input, 
and it passed all the test cases on the first try.
