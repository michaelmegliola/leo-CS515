What challenges did you encounter? And how did you address them?

Because the header file requires both forward and reverse iterators, I did not expect that the
decrement operator would need to work starting from the forward end, or starting from the reverse
beginning. I added dummy nodes at either end to support those operations. I found Mimir's feedback
to be inadequate when debugging my original program, because I could not reproduce the failures.
