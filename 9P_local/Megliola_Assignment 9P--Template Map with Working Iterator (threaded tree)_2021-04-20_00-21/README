What challenges did you encounter? And how did you address them?

On this program in particular; I would have liked the ability to write my own helper
functions and code pattern. After getting the test cases, I noticed my biggest mistake
was not understanding how to use the provided rethread in my assignment operator. Also,
I would have set up a reverse iterator because I needed the predecessor several times.
