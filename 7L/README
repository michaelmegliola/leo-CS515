I spent a solid 40 to 50 minutes thinking the stack was printed vertically instead of horizontally.
I only noticed because I was looking in a debugger and saw that the right and left children of root
were not what I expected. I also spent a little while thinking I could use _root as the root instead
of _root->left. I realize I could have use std::queue to represent a stack, but instead I included
std::stack.
