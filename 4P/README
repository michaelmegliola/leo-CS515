I attempted an optimisation by copying only the elements of the prior array that were necessary when expanding capacity
in enqueue. I had to write over all other elements to satisfy valgrind (uninitialized element error). It would not have
caused a seg fault or other error because my algorithm would always write over these elements before reading them.
